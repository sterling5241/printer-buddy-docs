# Install

There are two ways to install Printer Buddy. Either way it talks to each printer's Moonraker over the network, and the install steps are the same.

=== "On a printer"

    Install it on the printer's own Klipper host (the Pi or board running Klipper and Moonraker).

    **Good for:** one printer, or a small setup where you don't want a dedicated host.

    **You need:**

    - A printer running Klipper + Moonraker on Debian-based Linux (most Pi-based printers, MainsailOS, FluiddPi…)
    - SSH access to it, plus `git` and `python3`

    **Good to know:**

    - The installer adds `printer-buddy` to Moonraker's service list, so you can restart it from Fluidd or Mainsail too.
    - Port 8080 is often taken by the printer's webcam &mdash; the installer then offers the next free port.
    - Keep it light: AI **basic** at most.

=== "On a dedicated host"

    Install it on a dedicated host on the same network as your printers &mdash; a Raspberry Pi, a NAS, a home server or an old PC.

    **Good for:** several printers, AI **heavy**, timelapses of every printer, or cameras plugged into the host.

    **You need:**

    - A host running Debian-based Linux (Raspberry Pi OS **64-bit**, Debian, Ubuntu…)
    - `git` and `python3` (the installer adds `python3-venv` if it's missing)
    - Printers running Klipper + Moonraker on the same network

## How heavy is it?

Readings from real setups. More coming as members send theirs.

| Host | Setup | Printers | Memory | CPU idle | CPU printing | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 4 | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; |
| On a printer | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; |
| x86 PC / server | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; | &mdash; |

!!! tip "AI detection needs 64-bit"
    The AI models need a 64-bit system (`aarch64` or `x86_64`). On a Pi, use Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit). Everything else works on 32-bit, and a 32-bit version of the lite AI model is planned.

## Install it

Same for both: SSH in and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sterling5241/printer-buddy.git
cd printer-buddy
./install.sh
```

The installer opens a menu. Pick **1) Install** and answer the setup questions (see [Install choices](choices.md)), or install with the defaults and no questions:

```bash
./install.sh -y
```

It sets up a Python environment, downloads the parts you picked, creates the `printer-buddy` service and starts it. When it's done it prints the address, usually:

```
http://<its-ip>:8080
```

## Adding printers

1. Open Printer Buddy and click **Scan network**. It checks your local network for Moonraker (ports 7125 and 80, plus Moonraker's own network announcement). It only *lists* printers &mdash; it doesn't connect to any yet.
2. Tick the printers you want and click **Add selected**.
3. If a printer's Moonraker has login turned on, enter its **API key** when asked.

Printer not found? Use **Add by IP** and type its address (and port, if it isn't 7125).

## Port

Printer Buddy uses port **8080**. If something else already has it (often the webcam streamer on Klipper boxes), the installer says what's using it and offers the next free port.

Change it later with **P) Change port** in the installer menu, or:

```bash
./install.sh -y --port 8081
```
