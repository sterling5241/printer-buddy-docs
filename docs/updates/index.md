# Updates

Printer Buddy is made of parts that update separately:

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Printer Buddy** | The core app |
| **Interface** | The web pages |
| **Notifications** | Alerts to ntfy, Discord, Telegram, Pushover and email |
| **Timelapse** | Timelapse recording |
| **Camera streamer** | Only if it's on |
| **AI model** | Only if AI is on |

## The Updates list

Open **☰** on the home page and scroll to **Updates**. Each part shows the installed version and, if there's a newer one, what it updates to. Under **Printers** you'll also find each printer's own updates (Klipper, Moonraker, Fluidd…) from its Moonraker update manager.

## Update and Update all

**Update** on a row updates that part; **Update all** does everything. Printer Buddy restarts when it's done and the page reloads by itself. Prints on the printers keep going.

Tier menus (Interface basic/advanced, Camera streamer tier, AI model) switch that part and download it straight away.

## Stable and nightly

- **stable** &mdash; tested releases with version numbers (like v1.2.5).
- **nightly** &mdash; built every day from the newest code; may have bugs.

Stable is the default. Put a single part on nightly with [Dev/beta builds](dev-builds.md).

## Waiting

Sometimes a new version of a part needs a newer version of another part first. Its row then says **needs … first** and shows **Waiting** instead of Update. Update the part it names, and it'll be offered after.

## From the terminal

```bash
cd printer-buddy
./update.sh
```

Or run `./install.sh` and pick **3) Update**. The installer's Update also refreshes things the app can't do on its own (like Printer Buddy's root helper), so run it once if an update tells you to.
