# AI failure detection

Printer Buddy's own models look at the printer's camera during prints and score how likely each problem is.

## What it looks for

Spaghetti, warping, first-layer problems, stringing, blobs, cracks and other failures.

## Models

| Model | Runs on | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **basic** | A Raspberry Pi (64-bit) | Pick this on a Pi |
| **heavy** | A strong PC or a GPU | The most accurate |

!!! note "64-bit only for now"
    The AI needs a 64-bit system (Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit, or any x86_64 PC). A 32-bit version of the **lite** model is planned (lite only).

Pick one with **AI detection** in the installer. Every model release is tested on the same 1,000 photos; the scores are in each release's notes under **Model check**. With the v1.5 models, basic is right 93% of the time and catches 91% of failures; heavy is right 95% of the time with only 3% false alarms.

## When it alerts

It checks the camera every few seconds while a printer prints, and only alerts after **several checks in a row** look bad, so one odd frame doesn't set it off. Change these in **Settings → AI**:

| Setting | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Alert threshold | 40-80% | 60% |
| Check every | 5, 10, 20, 30 s | 10 s |
| Checks in a row | 1, 2, 3, 5 | 3 |
| Quiet after an alert | 5, 10, 20, 30 min | 10 min |

Higher threshold or more checks in a row = fewer false alarms, but a failure is caught a little later.

Per printer (AI watch on the printer page) you choose **Alert only**, **Alert + auto-pause** or **Off**.

## The failure box

When the AI thinks something's wrong, a red box on the camera shows where. **Box: on failure** (default) only works it out when a failure is likely; **Box: always** draws it on every check (uses more CPU). Turn both off to save CPU on older Pis.

## Detection area

By default the AI looks at the whole picture. To make it ignore clutter around the bed, click **Detection area** in the AI watch section and drag a box over the camera picture. **Clear area** goes back to the whole picture.

## Helping train it

- When it alerts, answer **Was it really a failure?** &mdash; false alarms are the most useful.
- **Save for AI…** saves the current camera view with a label.
- **Settings → AI** shows saved photos and how often the AI was right on your printers. Turn on **Help improve the AI** to send labelled photos for training.
